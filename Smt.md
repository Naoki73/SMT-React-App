### Lore
You can type in your favorite demon's name and pull up a small summary of it's real life lore. 



### Catch
You can type in a demon's name and pull up it's stats, which you can use to determine whether you want to add it to your own team or not, for use in the in-development Battle page.

### Battle
You will be able to battle other users' teams using that demon's particular skills

## Usage

With your directory inside of the "*SMT Flask backend*" folder, enter into your terminal the following commands:

<ol>
<li> python -m venv my_venv
<li> Windows: my_venv\scripts\activate or Mac: source venv/bin/activate (you can tell if this works if you see (my_venv) to the left of your terminal directory)
<li> pip install -r requirements.txt
<li> flask run
</ol>






Next, with your directory inside of the "*my-app*" folder, enter into your terminal "npm start".

That should be it!
